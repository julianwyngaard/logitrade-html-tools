# Shared Libraries

Reusable CSS and JavaScript components for Julian's HTML Tools.

## Files

- `common.css` - Shared styles (typography, buttons, status messages, layout)
- `common.js` - Shared utilities (status display, clipboard, URL handling)

## Usage

These files can be:
1. **Inlined** into single-file tools during development
2. **Referenced** via `<link>` and `<script>` tags for local development
3. **Copied** into new tools as a starting point

The goal is to maintain consistency while keeping each tool self-contained for distribution.
